### Macronutrients Logger
-------------------------

A log for your daily intake of macronutrients.

A final project for an online course, [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online) (highly recommended). 
We are given an HTML and a CSS boilerplate file along with a few details of the Food API we will be working with. 
From there it's up to us to code the app in vanilla JavaScript.

Once the project is complete I hope to slowly add things to the app, make it better..etc...It's a fun project! ðŸ˜Ž

No dependencies other than [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). ðŸ˜œ
