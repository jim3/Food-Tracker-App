### Macronutrients Logger
-------------------------

A log for your daily intake of macronutrients.

A final project for an online course, [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online), highly recommended! 
We are given an HTML and CSS boilerplate file. From there it's up to us to code the app in vanilla JavaScript.

Once the project is complete I plan to slowly add things to the app. It's such a fun project! 😎

No dependencies other than [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 😜
